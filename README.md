# BasketBallExpectedPoints

## How it works
Utilized 20+ years of historical NBA shot data to create a predictive statistic for the points expected for any shot taken in the future.
Wrote a program within Jupyter Notebook that uses Machine Learning (Random Forrest and Logistic Regression) to analyze factors (such as shot type, distance from basket, amount of defenders nearby, time on the shot clock, game state etc.) that have influenced shot outcome and ultimately create a statistic that helps us judge the "quality" and therefore preditced outcome of a shot.
Used Python and SQL to scrape, clean, and manipulate the data. Implemented One-Hot and Target Encoding to prepare the data for the Regression Algorithms.
Working towards further using Machine Learning to continue adding different factors that affect the outcome of a shot as well as well as use Feature Selection to improve the model.

## Example Output
I tested the model on data from the 2022/23 NBA Regular Season to see who the top performing players were.
